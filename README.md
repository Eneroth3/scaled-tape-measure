# Eneroth Scaled Tape Measure

Measure model with respect to customs scale. This can be useful when building a
physical scale model based on a full size digital model. I prefer keeping all my
digital models, even those of a planned physical model, "full size" as it
allows Copy/Paste in Place and prevents some clipping and precision issues.
